"Doubao Reading Position Marker" is a Chrome extension designed to solve a key pain point for users: difficulty returning to their reading spot when interrupted during long conversations with Doubao.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Chrome Extension APIs, it offers three core features: one-click marking of currently visible conversation text, accurate navigation back to marked positions, and local storage to retain marks across browser sessions.
Instead of the unstable method of relying on scroll containers, it uses a "text anchor" approach, adapting to potential structural changes on Doubaoâ€™s page. Lightweight and easy to use, it effectively resolves long-text positioning issues, boosting efficiency and experience for users interacting with Doubao.
